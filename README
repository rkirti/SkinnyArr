Usage
-----
g++ AdaptiveIntArray.cpp -o test


Current State
------------
* A crummy first-test that constructs an array of
integers by looking at the max. # of bits required
for the integer range and packs the array into
an int32_t array. 
* main() right now has toy test cases with 
insert and get. 
* The boundary-crossing case is not handled
i.e. when the AdaptiveInt spans 2 int32_t's
but should not be more than one hour of work
to write/test.

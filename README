Usage
-----
g++ AdaptiveIntArray.cpp -o test


Current State
------------
* A crummy first-test that constructs an array of
integers by looking at the max. # of bits required
for the integer range and packs the array into
an int32_t array. 
* main() right now has toy test cases with 
insert and get. 
* Only single boundary crossing handled -
assuming integers are not large enough
to cross 2 int32_t boundaries for now
